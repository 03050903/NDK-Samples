Payment Service - Support in-app purchases

========================================================================
Using a managed project vs. using a makefile project

 This package contains two different types of project options. One is an eclipse-based 
 managed project and the other is a makefile project. The managed project leverages 
 Eclipse to manage the build process so that you don’t have to worry about makefiles. 
 When using this option you can adjust build settings through the project properties. 
 The makefile project allows you to see and edit makefiles for direct control of the 
 build process. 

========================================================================
Sample Description:
 
 The Payment Service Sample is an application that is designed to show you how
 to support purchase requests in your applications using the Payment Service, 
 which is a service in the BlackBerry Platform Services library. You can
 register digital goods in the vendor portal for BlackBerry App World and allow
 users to purchase these digital goods in your applications.
 
 When you run the application, you can simulate a purchase by swiping down from
 the top of the screen. The simulated purchase request is performed in local
 mode, meaning that no information is sent to the Payment Service server and
 a simulated purchase response is received.
