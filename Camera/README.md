# Camera Sample

The Camera sample is a simple application for taking pictures.

In this sample, you will learn how to:

* Access the camera
* Start the viewfinder and acquire the corresponding viewfinder window handle
* Take a photo (non-blocking)
* Save a photo to the camera roll
* Pass argument data between the main thread and your callback threads
* Wake up your main thread using user-defined bps events from your callback threads

When the app is launched, you will see the camera viewfinder window.
Tap anywhere on the screen to take a photo.
