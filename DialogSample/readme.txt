Basic user input - Display a dialog

Using a managed project vs. using a makefile project

 This package contains two different types of project options. One is an eclipse-based 
 managed project and the other is a makefile project. The managed project leverages 
 Eclipse to manage the build process so that you don’t have to worry about makefiles. 
 When using this option you can adjust build settings through the project properties. 
 The makefile project allows you to see and edit makefiles for direct control of the 
 build process.

Sample Description:
 
 The Dialog Sample is an application that is designed to show you how to display
 a dialog in your application. This sample uses the dialog service, which is a
 service in the BlackBerry Platform Services library. You can use the dialog
 service to create various dialogs and set the properties for these dialogs,
 such as title, message, available buttons, and so on. You can also use this
 service to retrieve information about the dialog button that a user pressed.
 
 When you run the application, you can display an alert dialog by swiping down
 from the top of the screen. An alert dialog is a simple dialog that contains a
 title, message, and buttons.
